                <strong>In 1516, the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and proceeded to be ruled<br>
                 as a part of Ottoman Syria for the next four centuries. In 1660, a Druze revolt led<br>
                  to the destruction of Safed and Tiberias. In the late 18th century, local Arab<br>
                   Sheikh Zahir al-Umar created a de facto independent Emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman <br>
                   attempts to subdue the Sheikh failed, but after Zahir's death the Ottomans regained <br>
                   control of the area. In 1799 governor Jazzar Pasha successfully repelled an assault<br>
                    on Acre by troops of Napoleon, prompting the French to abandon the Syrian campaign. <br>
                    In 1834, a revolt by Palestinian Arab peasants broke out against Egyptian conscription<br>
                     and taxation policies under Muhammad Ali. Although the revolt was suppressed,<br>
                      Muhammad Ali's army retreated and Ottoman rule was restored with British support<br>
                       in 1840. Shortly after, the Tanzimat reforms were implemented across the <br>
                       Ottoman Empire.<br>
